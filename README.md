# SVG-Logo-Maker

## Description

In this challenge, I make a logo generator with a shapes testing to test the render of the shapes. The code asks users 4 questions on how they want their logo to look and it generates the code needed for the logo to show up.

## Installation

I used visual studio code to create this code in a index.js file and multiple shape files including the shapes.test.js file to test the shapes.
